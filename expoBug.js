This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is not very informative, but it usually points to an issue with the Android build process itself.  It can manifest in several ways, such as an abrupt termination of the build process with no clear error message, a vague mention of a Gradle error, or a more specific error related to a missing dependency or configuration problem within the Android project.  The root cause can be tricky to diagnose as it often involves intricate details of the Android build system.  It might be due to issues like incorrect Android SDK versions, problems with Gradle configurations, dependency conflicts, or issues with native modules.  Debugging usually involves meticulously checking Gradle logs, SDK settings and ensuring all necessary Android development tools are properly installed and configured.
