The solution to this problem requires a methodical approach to debugging the Android build system. Here are some key steps:

1. **Examine the Gradle Logs:** The most crucial step is to carefully review the Gradle build logs.  These logs usually provide more detailed information about the build failure than the Expo CLI output.  The location of the Gradle logs varies depending on your system and Expo setup, but they are typically found within your project's Android directory.

2. **Check Android SDK Setup:** Ensure that the Android SDK is properly installed and configured.  Verify that the correct SDK version is specified in your `android/gradle.properties` file and that all necessary SDK components are installed.

3. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** Conflicts between libraries can cause subtle build failures.  Use a dependency analyzer or carefully examine your `package.json` file to identify and resolve any possible conflicts. Tools like `npm-check-updates` or `yarn why` can help.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes a clean build can resolve temporary issues.  Try running `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`.

5. **Update Expo and related dependencies:** Outdated packages can sometimes cause compatibility issues. Update expo and related packages to the latest versions.

6. **Use a Debug Build:** Generating a debug build (`expo build:android --type=development`) might provide more verbose logs which might give a clear indication of the issue.

7. **Try a Fresh Project:** As a last resort, creating a minimal Expo project and gradually adding components can help isolate the problematic dependency or configuration.  This helps rule out issues within your specific project configuration.

Note that the exact cause and fix will vary depending on the unique context of your project and its dependencies.
